I applied my expertise in machine learning and embedded systems to develop a real-time ECG (electrocardiogram) analysis system. The objective was to enhance patient monitoring by detecting and diagnosing cardiac anomalies accurately and swiftly. Utilizing a combination of Python and advanced signal processing techniques, the system provides immediate feedback and alerts, contributing to proactive healthcare solutions and potentially life-saving interventions.
The model performed the classification with a training accuracy of 92.5%, all the data predicted and the results given by the model in ‘.csv’ format are present in the results folder. 
All the predictions of all the five classes are saved in ‘.npy’ format. Also the macro_auc of each data(train, validation, test) are saved in ‘.csv’ format. Macro_auc is basically the average Area Under Curve(AUC) calculated across different classes.
